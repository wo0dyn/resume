  abstract     = {This thesis presents a literature review of emotions, focusing on 
                  computational psychological models for future implementation in a 
                  conversational recommendation agent architecture. Consistent with 
                  existing implementations, this study supports the preference for the 
                  OCC model. Following the restoration of the ACORE platform (developed 
                  by the MAGMA team), we propose integrating emotions through Speech Act 
                  theory.},
